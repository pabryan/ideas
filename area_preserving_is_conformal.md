Area perserving maps and conformal maps
====

- The projection of a cylinder onto a sphere is area-preserving, but not an isometry. It is however, conformal. Question: is every map preserving the Riemannian measure, conformal? Probably for surfaces. Is this topological? Can it always be solved locally, i.e. on simply connected domains and so the global problem is just patching and hence obstructed by cohomology.
