Solitons for hypersurface flows
====

- Conformal, gradient vector fields yield integrability
- Some sort of monotonicity? This would be related to Smoczyk's space/time track minimal surfaces.
- Blow up singularities via conformal transformations? The blow up limit say for a sphere could actually lie in the sphere again itself. Is this useful?
- What do CMC surfaces in the space/time track correspond to as a flow?
